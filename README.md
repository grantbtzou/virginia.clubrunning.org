Club Running Website
------

In the beginning, there was nothing.

One of the things I wanted to do when I inherited this website was to document some of the codebase's darkest corners.

I hope to extend this document with maintenance notes, so stay updated for that.


## Todos

- Make sure all positions are reflected in the Contact Us page (social chair)
- Start putting workout schedules on the website (web app? automatic static deployment?)
