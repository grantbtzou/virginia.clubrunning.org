			We meet as a team at the start of practice at Nameless Field. Our meeting time is Monday - Thursday at 5pm during daylight savings (March to November) and 4pm after daylight savings (November to March). We don&rsquo;t have official practices on Fridays, although a number of our members will still show up to run together at the regular time. Saturday mornings are track workout days at 8:30 am, and Sunday mornings are long run days meeting at 9 am. Every Sunday night an email is sent out with the exact training plan for that week which includes two schedules, one for those who prefer higher mileage and one for those who train better with shorter mileage or are not looking to run competitively. While I ultimately design the workouts, I encourage feedback because my job is to make sure everyone personally gets the best training they can.

		<h4>Abs</h4>
		<p>
			Tuesday the schedule says hip exercises and/or abs. I personally feel like a stronger runner when my core feels strong so I do a set of 10 x 1 minute ab exercises including regular crunches, planks, six inches, etc. I know people tend to have their own preferences with ab workouts, but feel free to contact me if you want my specific workout or guidance and I can give you some advice.
		</p>
		<h4>Hips</h4>
		<p>
			As for hip exercises, these are really important for injury prevention early on, you&rsquo;ll thank yourself later for doing them. For ideas for specific exercises I usually do 15 of each exercise on each side with leg circles, leg lifts, clamshells, fire hydrants, and donkey kicks. For more ideas of what these are and what other exercises to do, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4a-BEf4RoU&feature=youtu.be">here is a link to a great video Rachel made last year.</a> I&rsquo;ll also be available at practice for any questions or tips.

<ul class = "list-group">
<li class = "list-group-item list-group-item-info">Easy/Long/Cardio</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
At this pace conversation should be comfortable, though exertion is still expected, especially on a longer run. You should not be short of breath at the end of a run. These runs prepare your body for workouts and teach your body to effectively deliver oxygen to your muscles. </li>
<li class = "list-group-item list-group-item-info">Tempo Runs</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Tempo runs are sustained running at about 85% of total speed and effort. This pace should be an “uncomfortably easy” or “comfortably hard” pace. You should still be able to talk, but it should be uncomfortable to do so. After a tempo workout you should not feel spent, but tired. You should feel strong while running at this pace. Tempo running produces lactic acid, and allows your body to figure out how to flush it out of your system.</li>
<li class = "list-group-item list-group-item-info">Hill Workouts</li>
<li class="list-group-item"> Hills includes finding a fairly steep incline that is long enough to go up for the designated amount of time usually 30 to 90 seconds). You are supposed to sprint or go hard up the hill, depending on fitness. This develops speed, power, and form for a runner.</li>
<li class = "list-group-item list-group-item-info">Intervals/Repeats/Hard </li>
<li class="list-group-item">These runs should feel hard. The pace should be quick for the given distance and sustainable for every repetition after the given rest. These workouts develop race speed and mentality.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info"> Strides </li>
<li class="list-group-item"> These are run at 90-95% of all speed and effort for 50-100m. These work on form and leg turnover, so it is an exercise of going fast but with the best form possible. These are usually added to easy days so that speed is touched on every day. </li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info"> Stretching and Strength Training </li>
<li class="list-group-item"> A part of injury prevention and running improvement is stretching and strength training. Both involve the entire body to ensure no weaknesses appear. Dynamic stretches occur before and after runs, while static stretching happens after running. Strength training involves General Stength, Core, Plyometrics, Stability, and Lifting. </li>

			I am a second year student at UVA from Washington, DC and am double majoring in Global Sustainability and Economics with a minor in French. I have been running ever since middle school where I was one of two girls on my cross country team and have been enjoying the sport ever since. Joining the Running Club my first year was one of the best decisions I made both because of the high level of training I have been able to maintain as well as the many close friendships I have formed with my teammates. I love to see new faces at practice and hope anyone interested will come out and join us!
