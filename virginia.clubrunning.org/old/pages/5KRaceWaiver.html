	<p>
	I know that running a road race is a potentially hazardous activity.  I will not enter and run unless I am 
	qualified, in good health, medically able, and properly trained. I assume all risks associated with this 
	event including, but not limited to:  falls, contact with other participants, the effects of weather, 
	including high heat and/or humidity, traffic, and the conditions of the road, all such risks being known 
	and appreciated by me. I acknowledge that if I believe event conditions are unsafe, I will immediately 
	discontinue participation in the event.  I fully accept and assume all responsibility for losses, costs, and 
	damages I incur as a result of my running this event.   I agree to abide by any decision of a race official 
	relative to my ability to safely complete the run.  Having read this waiver, knowing these facts, and in 
	consideration of accepting my entry, I for myself and anyone entitled to act on my behalf, discharge, 
	waive, and release UVA Club Cross Country and Track team, Girls on the Run of Central Virginia, and all 
	other sponsors, along with their officers, directors, agents, volunteers and employees from all claims or
