            <p>
                We can't wait to welcome new members into our ranks, whether you're a first-year, a transfer student, or
                just new to the club.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Practice</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>We hold "official" practices Monday-Thursday at 5pm. We meet at <a
                            href="https://goo.gl/maps/hjGxPD6B3YRXYb5m6">Nameless Field.</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>At practice, we'll break into pace groups and go for a run or do a workout, depending on the day.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Saturdays are typically workout days. We meet in the morning at Nameless.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Unofficial, informally organized long runs are typically held on Sunday.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Again, <strong>practice attendance is not required</strong> in any capacity. Just show up, meet
                        some people, run, and have fun.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Meets</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>We typically go to meets every 2-3 weeks. These meets are usually in other college towns nearby.
                        We have a home meet, usually held in October. The National Intercollegiate Running Club
                        Association (NIRCA) hosts a national race, which only a select group of runners will get to
                        compete in. Nationals is in November.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once a schedule is finalized, the meet coordinators will send it out over the mailing list.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>In the past, we've also organized group fitness classes, trips to the Sunset Series at Carters
                        Mountain Orchard, and pickup sports on Fridays.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Racing dues can be paid at any time, so there's no pressure to commit until you know you want to
