					The club practices Monday through Friday at 5:00pm during the fall and at 4:00pm during the winter and spring at Nameless Field near Memorial Gym. Weekend practices are scheduled on an individual basis and are coordinated with the team email list. <a href="contact">Request an invitation</a> No practices are mandatory; some runners attend only a few practices a week while many of our runners attend as many as possible. We also use Strava to track our runs.

				<p>
					The club attends more than half a dozen cross country and track meets throughout the year, including NIRCA Regional and National Championships. We have the opportunity to compete against a variety of Division III and club teams from across the country, and the Hoos represent well at almost every meet. The club offers runners of all skill levels an opportunity to push themselves to race at a collegiate level without the time commitment of a varsity team. <a href="meets">See our meet schedule</a>

				<h3 class="pad-bottom">Community. <span class="weak italic">More than just running.</span></h3>
				<p>
					The club enjoys a close-knit social community in addition to its training. We host team parties, enjoy group dinner after practice every evening, organize intramural teams for soccer and dodgeball, and go on day trips to Kings Dominion, Carters&rsquo; Mountain, and other nearby attractions. We&rsquo;re a close-knit group that loves to welcome new members&mdash;we hope you can find your place with us!
